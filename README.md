# jupyter_notebooks_for_ops
Jupyter Notebook for Ops

These are the notes, slides and examples for my talk at LISA 2019 in Portland, OR, US on 
Wednesday, October 30, 2019 at 9:45 AM Portland time (UTC-7).

The goal of this talk is for the listener to come away with a general understanding of the following:

* What Jupyter Notebooks are and how they came to be,
* How they can be useful in an operations capacity,
* How ops professionals can facilitate workflows for clients and collaborators who use notebooks for
data analysis and interchange
